# Aviation KPIs Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting flight profitability based on various aviation Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The model is built using **LightGBM** and is trained on a dataset containing flight-related metrics such as delay times, aircraft utilization, load factor, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and validation is stored in `Aviation_KPIs_Dataset.xlsx`. It includes **200,000 rows** with **18 columns**, covering various flight metrics and financial outcomes.

## Model
The model is a **LightGBM regressor** (`LGBMRegressor`) trained to predict the `Profit (USD)` based on the provided features. The model is saved as `flight_profit.pkl`.

## Usage
1. **Training**: The model is trained using the provided dataset. The training script splits the data into training and validation sets, scales the features, and trains the model.
2. **Prediction**: The trained model can be used to predict flight profitability on new data. Predictions are saved in `predictions.csv`.
3. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **RÂ² Score**, and **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.

## Files
- `code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Aviation_KPIs_Dataset.xlsx`: The dataset used for training and validation.
- `flight_profit.pkl`: The trained LightGBM model saved as a pickle file.
